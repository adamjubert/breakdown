# Breakdown

### Background
Breakdown takes two classic arcade games, 'Pong' and 'Breakout', and combines them into one fun game. The main screen is split into two smaller screens: the left screen contains Breakout, while the right contains Pong. Players must multitask by playing both games at the same time. The game is over when the player's lives run out.

### Functionality & MVP
Users are able to:
- [x] Start the game on 'ENTER'
- [x] Move each paddle with its respective keys
- [x] Activate power ups by catching them with the Breakout paddle
- [x] View their score and the global high score after losing
- [x] Toggle sounds on & off

In addition, this project will include:
- [x] A main menu describing the rules and prompting players to play
- [x] A production README

### Wireframes
Breakdown will consist of a main menu showing the global high score, controls, and power up information. After pressing ENTER, users will immediately start the game. There will be two screens, the left one being Breakout and the right being Pong. When the player runs out of lives, they will be returned to the main menu.
