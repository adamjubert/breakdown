# Gong

### Background
Gong is based off of the classic arcade game 'Pong', with a twist: the louder you hit the gong (the closer the ball is to the center of your paddle), the more points you score. Players do not score points by hitting the ball behind the opponent's paddle; 'missing' a ball just results in a gain of 0 points. The loudest player, the one who scores the most points in 30 seconds, wins.

### Functionality & MVP
With Gong, users will be able to:
- [ ] Start, pause, and reset the game
- [ ] Move their gong up and down with the arrow keys
- [ ] View the results (win or loss) along with their score after 30 seconds of gameplay

In addition, this project will include:
- [ ] A main menu describing the rules and prompting players to play
- [ ] A production README

### Wireframes
This app will consist of one screen. The game will start with a modal displayed over the game screen, explaining the rules and prompting the player to start. When the player clicks start, they will start a 30-second game. Paddles will have 3 colors: yellow on the outsides, red in the center, and orange in between. Players score 3 points for red, 2 for orange, 1 for yellow, and 0 for a miss.
